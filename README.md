JYRAPHE
=======

Jyraphe is a simple file upload utility written in PHP.


Requirements
------------

A web server such as Apache or Nginx, PHP 5.4 or above and sqlite support (should come as part of PHP except on debian-based distributions).

Optionally, you may need [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).


Installation
------------

You can either install from a pre-packaged archive, or from the original source code.

### From source
Clone the original source code somewhere. Then change to that directory and run composer like so:

    composer install

Then continue with the pre-packaged installation.

### From the package
Visit the page http://yourjyraphe.com/install. This will initialize the sqlite database.
